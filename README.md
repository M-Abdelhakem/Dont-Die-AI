# 🚨 Don't Die AI 🚨

**Your Personal Safety Companion.** When life throws unexpected situations your way, **Don't Die AI** is there to diagnose, assist, and alert the right people—all while keeping you safe.

> 💡 *"When things go weird or unsafe, we’ll make sure you don’t face it alone."*

## ✨ Project Background

This project was built during the **Minerva Hackathon 2024**, where the theme focused on tackling **common problems in the Bay Area**. Our team decided to address one of the most pressing issues: **drug abuse and overdose prevention**.

With thousands of overdose cases happening every year, especially in urban areas like San Francisco, we wanted to create a solution that could help people in distress, diagnose potential emergencies, and get help to them quickly. **Don't Die AI** was born out of this need—combining **real-time diagnostics**, **location sharing**, and **automatic emergency contact** to provide a powerful safety net for anyone in danger.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 😷 **I Feel Weird**
Not feeling well? Just hit the **"I Feel Weird"** button, and our chatbot will diagnose your symptoms through a series of 5-7 questions. Based on the diagnosis, we either:
- Give advice to keep you safe
- Alert your selected friends with your **location** if things look dangerous

💡 *If you stop typing, a pop-up will ask if you're okay. No response? We alert your friends or emergency services right away.*

### 👀 **I See Something Weird**
Spotted something off? Tap **"I See Something Weird"** and describe what you see. Our chatbot will figure out if it’s dangerous and:
- Ping your friends if it is
- Provide guidance on what to do next

### 🚨 **I Feel Unsafe**
For those moments when things are discreet but not right. This feature is tailored for **preventing sexual assault (SA)** and activates your camera + audio, sharing them live with your trusted friends.

If they don’t respond, we’ll contact **911** and share your location.

### 🌍 **Location Sharing**
Your location is always shared with your selected contacts, and it pops up if you’re in a dangerous situation. Whether it’s through the "I Feel Weird" or "I Feel Unsafe" modes, we make sure your friends know where to find you.
